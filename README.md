# call-me-names
Google assistant action that gives you a fun name

call-me-names is a voice action for Google assistant. The code is supposed to be deployed on Firebase and called by a Dialogflow intent. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, take a few hours and read through https://developers.google.com/actions/extending-the-assistant.

You can import intents and entities into Dialogflow from call-me-names.zip.

This is a little fun app which asks you for your given name and adds three mock names to it. It's a smash hit with kids - but don't feel offended. This voice action is **in German** but the code (functions/index.js) is easy enough to be modified quickly.
